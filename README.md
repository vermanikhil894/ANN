# ANN

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms. Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another. ANNs are efficient data-driven modelling tools widely used for nonlinear systems dynamic modelling and identification, due to their universal approximation capabilities and flexible structure that allow to capture complex nonlinear behaviors.
